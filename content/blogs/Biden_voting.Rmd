Biden Approval Margins

Website fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's-approval](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/)

Analysis of the approval rate

```{r Plot for Biden approval rate}
# Using `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
approval_polllist %>% 
  #convert end-date into "date" format:
  mutate(date_poll = mdy(enddate)) %>% 
  #extarct year from date
  mutate(Year_poll = year(date_poll)) %>%
  #get week number from date 
  mutate(week_no = isoweek(date_poll)) %>%
  #filter out data for year 2022 and eliminate week 52
  filter(Year_poll== 2022, week_no != 52) %>%
  #week-wise average approval rate line plot for different sub-groups 
  group_by(subgroup,week_no) %>% 
  #get mean approval rate (difference of approve & disapprove), standard deviation of approval rate and total number   of votes in each group
  summarize(approval_rate = mean(approve - disapprove), approval_sd = sd(approve-disapprove), n = n()) %>% 
  ungroup(subgroup,week_no) %>% 
  #confidence interval
  mutate(low = approval_rate - 1.96*approval_sd/sqrt(n)) %>%
  mutate(high = approval_rate + 1.96*approval_sd/sqrt(n)) %>%
  #Plot the graph of week number vs approval rate 
  ggplot(aes(x=week_no,y=approval_rate, color = subgroup))+
  facet_wrap(~subgroup, nrow = 3, strip.position = "right")+
