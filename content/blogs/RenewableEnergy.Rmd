The following is a description of the variables of the Cross-country Historical Adoption of Technology (CHAT) dataset.

| year         | double    | Year                           |
| group        | character | Group (consumption/production) |
| category     | character | Category                       |
| value        | double    | Value (related to label)       |

```{r,load_technology_data}

technology <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-07-19/technology.csv')

# Make smaller dataframe on energy

co2_percap <- wb_data(country = "countries_only", 
                      indicator = "EN.ATM.CO2E.PC", 
                      start_date = 1970, 
                      end_date = 2022,
                      return_wide=FALSE) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(value)) %>% 
  #drop unwanted variables
  select(-c(unit, obs_status, footnote, last_updated))

# Get a list of countries and their characteristics

```

First, produce a graph with the countries with the highest and lowest % contribution of renewables in energy production. This is made up of `elec_hydro`, `elec_solar`, `elec_wind`, and `elec_renew_other`. You may want to use the *patchwork* package to assemble the two charts next to each other.

```{r min-max_renewables, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.width = 10.3, fig.height = 5.5}

# Select relevant columns and pivot data frame into wide format
energy_wider_2019 <- energy %>% 
  filter(year == 2019) %>% 
  select(country, value, variable) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "variable",
              values_from = "value") %>% 
  replace(is.na(.),0) %>% 
# Calculate percentage of renewable energy
  mutate(total_perc_renew = ((elec_hydro + elec_solar + elec_wind + elec_renew_other)/elecprod),
         country = fct_reorder(country,total_perc_renew)) %>%
# Filter out countries with no renewable energy production in 2019 & remove North Macedonia because of wronly calculated elecprod
  filter(total_perc_renew > 0, total_perc_renew != Inf)

# Create max graph
top20_renewable <- energy_wider_2019 %>% 
  slice_max(total_perc_renew, n = 20) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total_perc_renew, y = country)) +
    geom_col() +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.border = element_blank()) +
    labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) + 
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())

# Create min graph
bottom20_renewable <- energy_wider_2019 %>% 
  slice_min(total_perc_renew, n = 20) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total_perc_renew, y = country)) +
    geom_col() +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.border = element_blank()) +
    labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())

# Combine graphs into one with patchwork
combined_renew_graph <- top20_renewable + bottom20_renewable

# Add labels to the combined graph
combined_renew_graph +
  plot_annotation(title = "Highest and lowest % of renewables in energy production",
       subtitle = "2019 data",
       caption = "Source: NBER CHAT Database")

```

Second, you can produce an animation to explore the relationship between CO2 per capita emissions and the deployment of renewables.

> As the % of energy generated by renewables goes up, do CO2 per capita emissions seem to go down?

If percentage of renewable energy produced would have a negative correlation with CO2 emissions per capita, we would expect the data points to move along a negative slope from the top left towards the bottom right of the chart. Our observations yield interesting insights. When looking at poorer countries (low and lower middle income), we see generally lower CO2 emissions, but also cannot claim any significant effect of percentage of renewable energy produced on these emissions. The data points move along a horizontal line. In contrast, the wealthier countries (upper middle and high income) exhibit higher emissions, but we can see a slight correlation between the graphed variables. Nevertheless, this assertion should be viewed with a sceptical eye before assessing whether the correlation is statistically significant. The graphs provide a good first indication, but further analysis is recommended.

```{r animation, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.width = 7}

# Find renewable energy % since 1990
energy_since_1990 <- energy %>% 
  filter(year >= 1990) %>%
  select(iso3c, year, value, variable) %>%
  # Pivot wider to later calculate renewable energy %
  pivot_wider(names_from = "variable",
              values_from = "value") %>% 
  # Replace missing values with 0
  replace(is.na(.),0) %>% 
  # Calculate percentage of renewable energy
  mutate(total_perc_renew = ((elec_hydro + elec_solar + elec_wind + elec_renew_other)/elecprod)) %>% 
  # Select only necessary columns
  select(iso3c, year, total_perc_renew) %>% 
  # Remove infinite values because of faulty 0 value in total energy production
  filter(total_perc_renew <= 1)

# Join CO2 emissions data with country and renewable energy % data
co2_percap_joined <- co2_percap %>% 
  rename("year" = "date") %>% 
  left_join(countries, by = "iso3c") %>% 
  left_join(energy_since_1990, by = c("iso3c","year"))

# Create faceted scatterplot for CO2 emissions and renewable energy %
co2_percap_joined %>% 
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total_perc_renew, y = value, color = income_level)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~income_level) +
  # Add animation
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', 
       x = '% renewables', 
       y = 'CO2 per cap') +
       transition_time(year) +
       ease_aes('linear') +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```
