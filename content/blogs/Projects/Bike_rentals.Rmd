The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks 14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).

```{r graph2,warning=FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 9}

# Find the expected weekly rental from 2016 to 2019
expected_weekly <- bike %>% 
  filter(year %in% 2016:2019) %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarize(expected_weekly_rental = mean(bikes_hired))

# join the expected weekly value to the row data
joined_weekly <- left_join(bike,expected_weekly,"week")

pct_change <- joined_weekly %>% 
  # Filtering for period of interest, removed week 52/2022 because wrongly graphed and all weeks 53 because not representative average
  filter(year %in% 2017:2022, !(year == 2022 & week == 52), week != 53) %>% 
  group_by(year,week) %>% 
  # The weekly change from the expected value
  summarize(weekly_change = 
              (mean(bikes_hired)-mean(expected_weekly_rental))/
              mean(expected_weekly_rental)) %>% 
  # Add a column to indicate whether the change is positive or negative
  mutate(p_or_n = case_when(weekly_change<0 ~ "Negative",
                            weekly_change > 0 ~ "Positive"))

pct_change %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week,y = weekly_change))+
  # Fill the back ground grey for Q2 and Q4
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 13,xmax = 26,ymin = -0.6, ymax = 1),
            fill = "grey90",alpha = 0.04)+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 39,xmax = 52,ymin = -0.6, ymax = 1),
            fill = "grey90",alpha = 0.04)+
  geom_line()+
  # Fill the area below line red if the change is positive
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymax = pmax(weekly_change,0), ymin = 0),fill = "green",alpha = 0.2)+
  # Fill the area below line green if the change is negative
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymax = pmin(weekly_change,0), ymin = 0),fill = "red",alpha = 0.2)+
  facet_wrap(~year, nrow = 2)+
  # Add rugs at the bottom indicating the value according to p_or_n
  geom_rug(mapping = aes(color = factor(p_or_n)), sides = "b",show.legend = FALSE) +
  # Set the rug value to red and green
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "green")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(13, 53, 13))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-0.5, 1, 0.5),
                     limits = c(-0.6,1),
                     labels = scales::percent)+
  labs(title="Weekly changes in TfL bike rentals",
       subtitle = "% change from weekly averages \ncalculated between 2016-2019",
       x="week",y = NULL,
       caption = "Source: TfL, London Data Store")+
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  theme_minimal()

```

For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2016-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020-2022 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`.

> Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

As the data under investigation follows a normal distribution, we should use the mean to calculate the expected values. The median would be more applicable if we were working with a skewed distribution, as this would distort the mean.
