<p>GDP components over time and among countries</p>
<p>The GDP data we will look at is from the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads">United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database</a>, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country’s GDP. <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6">GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars</a></p>

<p>We know that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption <em>C</em>), Gross Capital Formation (business investment <em>I</em>), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there was an indicator <code>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</code> in the dataframe, we calculated it with its components discussed above and found the difference in GDP calculated and the GDP figure included in the dataframe.</p>

<p>To commence our analysis, we looked at the similarities between the countries. It was clearly visible that household expenditure is by far the highest contributor to GDP in all countries. This was perfectly expected in general economics. For the remaining parts of the GDP, the order of magnitude of their contribution was also approximately the same for all countries. India and USA share a trade deficit for most of the years. This might be tracked back to China, the largest importer for both USA and India. Especially for Germany and the USA, we could see that the components of the GDP comprise approximately the same percentage respectively. This was to be expected, as these countries are considered developed countries of similar economy and society, generally speaking. India however seems to have a completely different story.</p>
<p>The first thing that became apparent was that India has visibly lower government expenditure than the comparison countries. This hasn’t been a usual trend for low-income countries, as they spend less on things such as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/government-spending#recent-data-on-the-size-of-governments">social protection</a>, health care and unemployment benefits. Nevertheless, India´s government expenditure has still been within a reasonable margin and has increased in recent years. Another interesting finding was the continual percentage contribution decrease in household expenditure since 1970. An explanation is quickly found, as we could observe gross capital formation mirroring the change in reverse. We could also deduct that the Indian population is investing more of their disposable income into assets, rather than spending it. It would be interesting to identify the precise reason for this shift.</p>
<p>The USA also displayed a shift of components, however here it concerns government expenditure and capital formation. The shift might be attributed largely to the government adapting their spending policy, investing more heavily in infrastructure and military machinery than intangible benefits for the public. As we could also see, the USA has been the only country for which the proportion of household expenditure follows has a positive slope. With the simultaneously increasing trade deficit, we could assume that US citizens increased their spending of foreign goods. This could be related to improving trade routes with China and Europe, as well as the rise of eCommerce in the later years. Of course, we also see a significant drop in gross capital formation around the time of the 2008 financial crisis, which also seems to have affected imports.</p>
<p>Last but not least, let us look at Germany. Looking at the visualization of the data, we could see the most stable distribution of GDP components over the years between the three countries. Germany has been able to reliably maintain a trade surplus over most years. Especially since 2000, trade seems to have become more central to Germany´s GDP. Such an observation has not been entirely surprising, giving that Germany has a strong footing in most large sectors (e.g. agriculture, pharma) and enjoys strong demand for its machinery and vehicles. Meanwhile, household expenditure contributes less to the GDP than observed in the other countries. This does not mean that Germans spend less, but that the GDP of Germany is just more evenly distributed between its components.</p>
